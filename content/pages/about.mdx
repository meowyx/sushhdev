I'm always passionate about new technologies and tools, constantly on the journey to learn something new. As a self-taught developer, I let my passion guide me. I go where it takes me, pushing myself in the direction of what truly excites me. Additionally, I take pride in contributing to open-source projects, as it's my way of giving back to the developer community. I hope you find inspiration and knowledge here, just as I do.

I'm part of the RAD(Rapid Application Development) Contractor Team at Consensys. Also a Product Pro Ambassador. Tech is my jam, and I'm always scouting for the next cool tool to dive into. ðŸ¤“
